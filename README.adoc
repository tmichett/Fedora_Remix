== Fedora Remix Creation Quickstart

This quickstart will provide a quick method to download a pre-built Fedora Remix as well as creating your own Fedora Remix Building system. The https://github.com/tmichett/Fedora_Remix has been created with Ansible playbooks that will setup a Fedora Remix Building system using the Fedora Remix installed from the liveCD provided (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UAT07AJIrTdMk3ke_QE6S6vz-qn6qGtR). The requirements are relatively simply to build and the system has Fedora Remix customization scripts and self-launching menu to assist with the initial setup. The quickstart and documentation are also available at the following link: https://tmichett.github.io/Fedora_Remix/.

.*Building your own Fedora Remix - Overview*

. Download the Fedora Remix ISO and install locally to hard drive
.. Setup a local user and ensure it is in the SUDOERS file
.. Run some the Fedora Remix customize scripts to create SSH keys and SUDO with no password
. Clone https://github.com/tmichett/Fedora_Remix
. Run the Ansible playbooks with the "sudo" command
.. Prepare_Web_Files.yml
.. Prepare_Fedora_Remix_Build.yml
. Modify the Kickstart files in */livecd-creator/FedoraRemix*
.. FedoraRemix.ks - To control various setup components and run commands
.. FedoraRemixPackages.ks - To control RPM packages that are installed as part of your Remix
. Run the *Remix_Build_Script.sh*
